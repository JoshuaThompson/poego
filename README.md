# Poego
Wrapper for Path of Exile Web API written in Go

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaThompson/poego.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaThompson/poego)

###Supported API Calls
1. GetLeagues*
2. GetLeague*
3. GetLeagueRules
4. GetLeagueRule
5. GetLadder
6. GetPvpMatches

More information about these calls can be found on the [Path of Exile API Website](https://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs/api) and in the [godoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/JoshuaThompson/poego).

*Note: The league API calls appear to be bugged in that the offset doesn't work properly and you can't get older leagues by id.  In order to get older information you
will currently have to use a tool like phantonmjs or some other web crawler.  

###Additional Functionality
1. GetEntireLadder
2. GetEntireLeagueLadder

These two calls make 75 (unfortunately, due to GGG's API implementation) requests over the course of 25~ seconds to the api in order to get the 15000 maximum ladder entries, with the league function returning the league information as well.  Be careful with how often you call either of these functions due to rate limiting.  

###Installation
```
go get github.com/joshuathompson/poego
```

###Tests
```
go test
```

###Usage 
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"github.com/joshuathompson/poego"
)

func main() {

	p := poego.NewPoeApi()

	//optional arguemnts can be passed via url.Values or map[string][]string
	//this is clearly demonstrated in a few of the tests
	leagues, err := p.GetLeagues(nil)

	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("%+v", leagues)
}

```
